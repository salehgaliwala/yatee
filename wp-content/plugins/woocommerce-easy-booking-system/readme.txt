A powerful and easy to use booking plugin for your WooCommerce store.

== Description ==

= Easy to use =

Rent your products in one click! Easy Booking is compatible with simple, variable, grouped and bundle products. An ideal solution to make the most of WooCommerce without having to manage a new product type.

= Flexible =

The right amount of options to adapt to your needs: "Days" or "Nights" mode, booking duration and limits, one or two date(s), price calculation… There are many possibilities. And for developers, filters and action hooks to extend features.

= Useful =

Easily keep an eye on processing or upcoming bookings from your WordPress dashboard.

= Demo =

Check the plugin demo [here](http://demo.easy-booking.me/).

= PRO version =

Add [Easy Booking PRO](https://easy-booking.me/plugin/easy-booking-pro/) if you need more features like stock management per date, disabled dates, prices depending on duration and/or dates, manual bookings and more.

== Installation ==

= Requirements =

WordPress 5.0 or greater
WooCommerce 4.0 or greater

Make sure WooCommerce is installed and activated before starting.

= Installation =

You can install the plugin automatically or manually. If you are not familiar with plugin installation, please refer to [this page](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#installing-plugins).

= Settings =

Learn how to configure the plugin and your products in the [documentation](https://easy-booking.me/documentation/).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I don't see the datepicker fields on my product page =

Make sure your product is purchasable. It needs to have a price and to be in stock.

Otherwise, it’s most likely an issue with your theme, which misses the woocommerce_before_add_to_cart_button action hook from WooCommerce templates. To be sure, try to temporarily switch to another theme (like Storefront or Twenty Twenty). If it works, please contact your theme support. You should never remove action hooks or filters.

Also, please note that Easy Booking is only compatible with “classic” WooCommerce product pages. It won’t work on other pages, pages created with shortcodes or pages created with a page builder.

= Nothing happens when I click the datepicker fields =

Please note that Easy Booking is only compatible with “classic” WooCommerce product pages. It won’t work on other pages, pages created with shortcodes or pages created with a page builder because scripts aren’t loaded.

If you are on a product page, there is probably a Javascript error preventing Easy Booking from working, most of the time coming from another plugin.  Open your browser’s console (F12 > Console), and look for any error. If you are not familiar with Javascript, please send an email with a screenshot of the error.

You can also disable your other plugins (keep only WooCommerce and Easy Booking) to see which one causes the issue and contact their support.

= "Sorry there was a problem. Please try again." error message =

This is a cache issue. Easy Booking is not compatible with cache plugins and unfortunately I haven’t found any solution yet.

If you can, disable caching on product pages (most cache plugins have an option to disable caching on given pages) or disable your cache plugin.

If you don’t have a cache plugin or if it still doesn’t work after disabling it, it can also come from your host. Some hosts have their own caching system (like WP Engine). In this case, you need to ask them not to cache product pages.

= I can’t select previous/next month on the calendar =

Go to Easy Booking > Settings > Appearance and make sure “Text color” is set to “#000000” and not “000000”. Then save (you might need to clear your browser’s cache after).

= My products are unavailable after a booking is made =

There is no stock management in the basic (free) version of Easy Booking. You need to get the PRO version in order to limit the number of bookings per day.

= I can't select any dates =

Check your settings. This is most likely because you have a custom booking duration and/or minimum/maximum booking duration set, and disabled/out-of-stock dates interfere with it.

= I can’t uncheck the bookable option on my products =

Make sure to uncheck the “All bookable” option in the plugin settings page (Easy Booking > Settings) if you want to have not bookable products.

= How can I change the "Start", "End", "/ day" or "Select date(s)" texts? =

There are several filter hooks available to change texts. Please check the [FAQ](https://easy-booking.me/support/) for more information.

= Is Easy Booking compatible with Networked Sites? =

Yes. You will need to install the plugin on the network, and then activate it on each site.

= How can I remove the price calculation? =

There is a filter hook available to remove price calculation. Please check the [FAQ](https://easy-booking.me/support/) for more information.

= How to make a product bookable and not bookable at the same time? =

You can make a variable product with two variations:

* one bookable
* one not bookable

Make sure to check the “Bookable” option on the parent product aswell.

Your customers will first have to select a “Buy” or “Rent” option (depending on how you named your variations) and then select date(s) if necessary.

= How do I limit the number of bookings per day? =

There is no stock management in the basic (free) version of Easy Booking. You need to get the PRO version in order to limit the number of bookings per day.

= How can I change the dates of an existing booking? =

Please check the [documentation](https://easy-booking.me/knowledgebase/orders/#edit-a-booking) about orders.

= The plugin doesn't do exactly what I need, is it possible to develop something custom? =

Easy Booking is meant to be simple and even if there are many possibilities, it remains a WordPress plugin. Therefore, if you have complicated requirements, I can only recommend developing a custom solution with a developer.

I personnaly don’t do custom development and I am not willing to add more features to Easy Booking.

= Can I have hours instead or in additon to dates? =

No, Easy Booking is only usable for dates selection.

= Is it possible to select dates on the shop page? =

No, dates need to be selected on the product page for each product individually.

= Can dates be selected on the cart/checkout/order page and applied to all products? =

No, dates need to be selected on the product page for each product individually.

= Can I have the date selection form on my home page (or any other page)? =

No, Easy Booking is only compatible with “classic” WooCommerce product pages. It won’t work on other pages, pages created with shortcodes or pages created with a page builder.

= How do I translate the plugin? =

Please check the [documentation](https://easy-booking.me/knowledgebase/plugin-translation/) about localization.
