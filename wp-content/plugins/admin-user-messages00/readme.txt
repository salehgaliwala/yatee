Admin User Messages is a simple plugin that allows communication just between admin(s) and single user(s), but not a communication between user and user.

== Description ==
With this plugin admins are able to communicate with their users. That is useful if you have a website where you don not want your users to talk with each other. Every term of the plugin is customizable, so you can translate it into your own language.

You will need to create some pages, to put following shortcodes in:

Inbox-Page:
[admin_user_messages_inbox]

Sent-Messages-Page:
[admin_user_messages_sent_messages]

Write-Message-Page:
[admin_user_messages_write_message]

Read-Message-Page
[admin_user_read_message]

Answer-Message-Page
[admin_user_answer_message]
